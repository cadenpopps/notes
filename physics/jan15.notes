Agenda
	Discussion of Pen
	Balloon + hair static demonstration
	Lecture slides

Notes

	Forces acting on a pen
		When held:
			Gravity + normal
		When dropped:
			Gravity + air resistance
		Pen exerts same force of gravity on earth + everyone in the room

	Humidity affects balloon's stickiness

	Make a model as simple as possible to describe what you need

	Regarding charge in this class: only electrons are added and removed

	Static electricity is deterministic - based on material and charge you will get certain results



Lecture

	Balloon with static from hair demonstration
		Since the paper moves, there IS a force - Î£F=ma

	Two pictures on title slide
		1: balloons repel each other
		2: balloon sticks to (wall?)

	Structure of matter
		Attraction:
			Protons and electrons attract
			Electrons repel each other
			Protons repel each other
			Neutrons do not interact with self or others

		The particles create these interactions due to the property of Electric Charge

		Electrons - negative charge (negative number)
		Protons - positive charge (positive number)
		Nuetrons - no charge (zero)

	Electric Charge
		Intrinsic property of matter
		Charge of object is dictated by the deficiency or excess of electrons
			The charge of an object must be a multiple of the charge of one electron
			q = 1.602 * 10^(-19)C

	Conductors
		Materials in which electrons (charges) move between atoms easily
		EX: copper, gold, etc.

	Insulators (Dielectrics)
		Materials in which electrons (charges) cannot move around much, do not transfer between atoms easily
		EX: wood, rubber

	Charging by friction
		_Contact electrification_ - Triboelectric effect - Static electricity
			The ability of a object to gain charge through contact with another object
				Transfer of electrons
			Depends on
				Roughness
				Chemical bonds or structure
				etc
			Triboelectric Table
				List of materials in order of willingness to share electrons
				Ex: glass, mica, nylon, fur, silk, paper, cotton, wood, acrylic, polystyrene, rubber, sulfur, saran wrap
				Leftmost materials are more likely to lose electrons when rubbed against materials further right
			Applications
				Rockets cannot launch through certain clouds due to contact electrification

	Charging by Induction
		Charging an object with another without losing the second object's electrons
			Charging without the transfer of electrons between the two objects
		When you use a negative object, electrons escape to the ground
		When you use a positive object, electrons are stolen from the ground
		EX:
			Materials: negatively charged rod, conductor with neutral charge
			As the negatively charged rod is moved toward the conductor, electrons move inside the conductor
				Positively charged electrons move toward the negative pole, negative move away
			Now ground the conductor (connect it to the ground with a wire or something else)
			When the negative charged rod moves toward the conductor, the electrons move away and into the ground
				This results in a positively charged conductor, while the rod never lost electrons

	Charging by Polarization
		Electric forces may appear on objects with no charge
		How it works
			Move a charged object towards a neutral dielectric object
			This causes the electrons to spend more time on one side
			This creates a charge in the nuetral object
		Balloon illustration
			It sticks to the wall, so the forces must be in equilibrium
			We know the wall is an insulator (non-metal)
			Known forces
				Gravity (down)
				Normal force (away from wall)
				Friction (up)
				Mystery attractive force (towards the wall)
			Electric force (?) pulls balloon towards the wall - what is this force?
				Creates strong enough normal force to cancel gravity with friction
				Balloon is negatively charged
				Positive charges in wall attract the negative charge in wall - polarization
				Wall (dielectric) does not conduct well, does not lose electrons quickly
